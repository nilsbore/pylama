># Comments
># look like this
># They are simply python comments
># Let us start our document:

# Title ># Comments can go after text as well

>color('blue') #> If a function is followed by indent, the indentation will be it's context, called "body"
    This
    is
    some really
    blue
    text

>color('red') #> If there is no indent after the function, it will have current indentation as its body

Some very, very red text

>color('normal') #> Reset color

Some normal text

## Section

### Subsection: Figures #> How do we write figures? Let's see...

>table(1, 3, width="\textwidth") # this is a table, with some content below:
    >cell(0, 0)
        >centering() #> Just affects the current indentation level
        ># this initializes the context of the figure and by default, a caption:
        >figure(caption="Some lovely red birds", image="birds.jpg", placement="htpb", width="\textwidth")
    >cell(0, 1)
        >raggedleft()
        This is the context of the second column.
    >cell(0, 2)
        >raggedright()
        This is the context of the third column.
    ># Imagine something like this for the future:
    ># >for num, cell in enumerate(context.table.cells):
    ># >   cell.set_label("birdfigure%d" % num)
